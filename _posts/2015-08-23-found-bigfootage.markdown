A game where you play as a blurry Bigfoot and must trick people into getting blurry footage of you so that they'll leave you alone. Get blurrier by putting more distance and foliage between, and you'll. Voted [first place in Theme category](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=30611) for the theme "You are the Monster". Features dynamic music and authentic Bigfoot shaders!
