description: A game made solo in 48 hours for [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) 33, for the theme "You Are The Monster". You are Bigfoot. You must trick people into getting blurry footage of you so that they'll leave you alone. Get blurrier by putting more distance and foliage between yourself and the camera. The blurrier you are, the more points you earn! Features dynamic music and authentic Bigfoot shaders! Voted [first place in Theme category](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=30611) out of 1198 games!
