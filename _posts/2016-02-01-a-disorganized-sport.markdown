description: A 2-player randomly-generated sports game. The rules of the game are randomly generated while you play the game! Balls, goals, and everything else on the field is also random. A third player can connect to your game using a separate app, and can add their own rules or objects. Or, you can stream the game on Twitch.tv, and viewers in the chat can mess with the game by typing commands such as "add banana" or "delete ball". ![screenshot 1](img/portfolio/sport1.png) ![screenshot 2](img/portfolio/sport3.png) Collaborated with Gregory Loden (Lead Programmer) and [Malhar Teli](malharteli.me) (UI & 3D artist)
