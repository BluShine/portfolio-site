description: Puzzle sniper game made solo in 48 hours for [Ludum Dare 28](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=30611) for the theme "You Only Get One". You're a sniper, and you have to take out every guard in the building, but you only get a one shot. Luckily, you can slow down time and curve your bullets around corners, and pierce or ricochet off walls. Voted **12th place** in the Theme category (out of 1281 games)! You can play the game in the window above if your browser supports Flash.
