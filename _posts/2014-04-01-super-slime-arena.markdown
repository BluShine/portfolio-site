description: A minimalist party fighting game. Every character has 1 attack, and every attack is a 1-hit-KO. Every slime is unique and easy to learn, but the wide range of character match-ups creates almost endless variety. Game modes like "shuffle" and "slime rush" push players to branch-out and play as every slime one-by-one in an all out last-slime-standing match. Now [Greenlit on Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=523122614#_=_)! Featured in [Boston Festival of Indie Games](http://schedule.bostonfig.com/artist/marktrbld). ![screenshot 2](img/portfolio/slime1.jpg) ![screenshot 2](img/portfolio/slime2.jpg) A collaboration with [Oskar Strom](http://thinkoskar.com/).
